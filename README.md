# EyeCare
Take care of your eyes by getting reminders to rest them (Windows only)

Grab a copy of my certificate and the `.appxbundle` from the releases page.

Install the certificate to your local machine into the the Trusted Root CA store, and then use the AppX file to install EyeCare. After that, running EyeCare will pop out a notification asking you to refocus your eyes. The easist way to use this is to create a task in Task Scheduler, which you can do by importing `EyeCare_task.xml` to Task Scheduler and making sure the usernames are all set to your own.

## Not comfortable installing my certificate?
That's ok! You'll just need to wait a while longer till I can package the app with a pre-trusted certificate, or publish it to the Microsoft Store.
